                            <strong>let:</strong> The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally
                            initializing it to a value.
                            Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared
                            in, which is usually denoted by curly braces {}.

                            <strong>var:</strong> The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable,
                            optionally initializing it to a value.
                            Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was
                            declared in. Global variables are available throughout your entire code.
                            <strong>const:</strong> The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant
                            variable, i.e. a variable that can’t be reassigned.
                            Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since
                            they are actually variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned.

                            are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be
                            called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not
                            constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions

                                        considered semantic because they accurately describe the purpose of the
